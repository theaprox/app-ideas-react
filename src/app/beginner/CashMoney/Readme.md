# Cash Moneys

**Tier:** 1-Beginner

Converting ~~dollars~~ *Euros* to cents would enable you to practice your fundamental knowledge of programming. Loops, if conditions and a simple algorithm will be used.
Your task is to let the user input a ~~dollar~~ *Euro* value (float), assuming that it can also accept extra cents (ex. 2.75), and convert it into an integer. After this, convert into coins with the sub-type of ~~dollars~~ Euro. Use an algorithm that would divide the dollar value to the four coin types, and output few coins as possible.

The challenge: Try this without using any frameworks.

**Weird moneys example:**
If you have 0.58, I would have 4 coins: 2 quarters, 0 dimes, 1 nickel and 3 pennies
*(still an example though...)*

**User Stories**

-   [ ] User can enter a ~~dollar~~ *Euro* value
-   [ ] User can see the total cents from the converted dollar value

**Bonus features**

-   [ ] User can see how many were ~~pennies, nickels, quarters and dimes~~:
**bills of**: *100, 50, 20, 10, 5*
 **and coins of**: *2, 1, 0.50, 0.20, 0.10, 0.05, 0.02, 0.01*
 from the total ~~cents~~ amount of money.
